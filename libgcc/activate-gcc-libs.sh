    # This is a workaroung for CentOS 7 and possibly other distros (e.g. Fedora)
    # which build Mesa OpenGL implementation with --static-libstdc++.
    #
    # Specifically in the case of CentOS 7, libGL.so loads dlopen's
    # dri_swrast.so which links to libLLVM-3.8-mesa.so.
    # It's libLLVM-3.8-mesa.so which is build with --static-libstdc++ and
    # contains the libstdc++ symbols.
    #
    # When running an C++ OpenGL application on CentOS 7, C++ symbols from both
    # the bundled libstdc++ and libLLVM. The order in which symbol lookup
    # depends on where the code is located:
    #
    #   http://stackoverflow.com/a/12667490/7859224
    #
    # So calls to C++ API can be executed either on libLLVM or libstdc++,
    # which can lead to undesired behaviour.
    #
    # The first problem is with static symbols. Static symbols are supposed to
    # be unique, but if you are dlopen'ing two libraries with static symbols
    # with the same name, the symbols may be duplicated unless they are
    # defined as unique.Â For example, this should show the symbol type
    # as 'u' for both libraries:
    #
    #   nm -D -C $LIBSTDCXX | grep std::string::_Rep::_S_empty_rep_storage
    #
    # Check the links bellow for detailed info about this problem. As CentOS 7
    # libLLVM correctly declares its static variables as unique, all we need
    # is to make sure our bundled libstdc++ does too (you may need a recent
    # binutils for that).
    #
    # The second problem that was found is much trickier. The locale stuff
    # provided by libstdc++ needs to do some initialization upon first use.
    # But when libLLVM and libstdc++ are loaded, the locale is initialized
    # first on libstdc++ and at some point again at libLLVM, leading to a
    # crash because the locale on libLLVM make checks using variables that
    # could be affected by the locale initialized on the bundled libstdc++.
    #
    # The last problem shows that it is really a bad idea to use
    # --static-libstdc++ and hopefully one they RedHat folks will agree with
    # that and fix RedHat/CentOS 7.
    # Meanwhile as a workwound it seems that adding the bundled libstdc++
    # to LD_PRELOAD avoid the second locale initialization to happen. This is
    # probably not guaranteed on any situation but the std::locale symbols
    # from libLLVM are not even executed when we set LD_PRELOAD.
